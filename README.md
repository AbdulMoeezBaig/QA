# Notes
1. Role of QA exists to prevent problems in applications  
2. QA = systematic process to determine wether a product meets specifications  
3. QA , QA Engineer, QA Analyst, Software Engineer, Test  
4. Starts with clear specifications -> implementation in code -> code is tested -> code released -> users test and give feedback
5. QA can be measured by customer happiness, revenue, or how well it does over time  
6. Relevant skills -> Technical aptitude, Business Knowledge, DevOps Principles, Process and Release Expertise
7. SDLC -> Software Development Life Cycle (Plan Define Design Build Test Deploy)
8. Plan, Define, Design (QA,dev,design,biz) -> Build, Test (Dev, QA, design) -> Deplot (dev, QA, biz)  
9. set expectations, check in on them regularly  
10. Tests template (Scenario -> Expected Result -> Latest Result -> Automation or not)  
11. AC (accpetance criteria) are the requirements that must be fulfilled in order for the product to be accepted by the stakeholder  
12. AC: 1. Given 2. When 3. Then 4. And  
13. Products are usually released after manual + automatic testing + AC check from product, design, and QA  
14. Black box testing -> focus on in and out (manual testing and UI automation testing) (Example: add an item, using UI, and see if it works.. try using webelements and check results  
15. Grey box testing -> Integration testing -> Trigger action in UI and see how code responses (Example: add an item and confirm via API if item waas added and price was updated / item was updated)  
16. White box testing -> completely transparent -> unit and system testing -> developers are responsible -> you see what happens to code throughout (Example. Inside the code, you provide values and exact expected results are received from the functions)  
17. Manual testing -> know what customers want and will do -> mostly like black box testing.. Think of scenarios
18. Happy path scenarios -> normal, Sad path scenarios -> search for invalid things  like invalid route or missing gaps  
19. UI automation -> manual testing -> test script -> should include many browsers and OS  
20. UI automate only large / main work  
21. No need of UI automation for sad path scenarios  
22. Integration testing -> sees how system reacts -> grey box testing -> QA / developers -> don't use UI but check via API  
23. Performance testing -> how system performs under load (black box testing)  
24. Performance testing (load testing -> for max capacity testing, (simulate many users searching and check when spikes and response time)
25. (Endurance testing -> check if performance deteriorates, takes longer than load testing for this)  
26. stress testing -> objective is to identify the breaking point of a system  (at what point it fails, how does it recover?)  
27. Common Performance includes (long load / response time, poor scalability , bottlenecking)  
28. Security testing -> looks to expose problems , stop from working, loss of customer data, decline in revenue , website down time  
29. SQL injection -> most common type of attacks (adding codes to text entries for harm)  
30. DOS (denial of service) -> flood the server with bots (traffic) searching and sending information to crash server  
31. backup servers are also used  
32. Github has a feature that can scan all dependencies (vulnerabilities) and can update improve  
33. Report, Priority ^ Severity(triage),  View, Assign, Close -> bugs management system 
34. Bug reporting software : Jira  Rally Github Bugzilla
